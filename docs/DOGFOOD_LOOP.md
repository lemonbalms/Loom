## 0. Naming (do not confuse)

| Name | Role |
|------|------|
| **Loom** | Product CLI / MCP (`loom`, `@loom/*`) |
| **Fable 5 / fable-advisor** | Review judgment model / agent — **not** the product |
| **`fable-advisor` subagent** | Claude Code advisor consult pinned to **Fable** model (spawned via Task/Agent) |
| **`fable-advisor` plugin** | Orchestration tooling (DannyMac180, MIT) providing the grok/codex/fable lanes — **the dev tool, not the product**. Currently **v3.1.0**. |
| **directory `fable-advisor/`** | Local checkout path only — the product is **Loom** (remote: `lemonbalms/Loom`). Dir name is historical, pending rename. |

**Lane version pins:** Grok 4.5 · GPT-5.6 Sol (codex, high reasoning) · Fable 5 (advisor, read-only) · plugin **v3.1.0**.
When the `fable-advisor` plugin updates, bump these pins here so cache drift stays visible.

## 0.5 Session orchestration line selector

“작업 line”은 단일 구현자 profile이 아니라 **최상위 orchestrator → implementation → verification/advice 전체 연결**이다. 새 세션은 Owner가 별도 선택하지 않으면 HANDOFF에 기록된 **직전 세션의 실제 전체 chain을 Default로 승계**한다. 세션 시작 briefing에서 Default와 아래 선택지를 먼저 보여주고, 선택이 없으면 Default로 즉시 진행한다.

| Choice | Orchestrator → implementation → verification/advice |
|---|---|
| **Current inherited default** | **Codex → Grok → Codex verification** |
| Claude line | **Claude → Grok → Claude Advisor** (`fable-advisor`) |
| Grok line | **Grok → Grok → Claude + Codex verification**; 둘 다 불가하면 **Grok verification fallback** |
| Other CLI | 설치·인증된 CLI를 선택할 수 있으나, 시작 전에 세 역할과 fallback을 명시 |

선택된 orchestrator 안에서는 **복잡·모호·설계/보안 판단 = 해당 CLI의 최상위 모델**, 그 외 승인·락된 일반 작업 = 차상위 모델을 쓴다. 아래 `*-impl`/`*-rev` profile은 이 전체 line 안에서 orchestrator가 배치하는 subordinate lane이며, 그 자체를 세션 “작업 line”으로 부르지 않는다.

## 1. Room & profiles (owner-configurable roster)

**이 표가 역할 배정의 SSOT다.** 아래 배정은 **기본값(default)**이며, 고정이 아니라
**오너 결정 사항**이다 — 모델 성능은 고정된 것이 아니라 계속 발전하고, 그에 따라
피어(레인)는 계속 추가될 수 있다. 역할 배정은 **오너가 주로 사용하는 모델**을
따라간다. 배정을 바꿀 때는 이 표의 Role 칸을 수정하는 것으로 결정을 기록한다
(별도 게이트 불필요 — 오너 결정이 곧 게이트). 에이전트는 벤더를 하드코딩해
가정하지 말고 **매 세션 이 표를 읽고** 자기 역할을 확인한다.

| Profile (`--profile`) | Display name | Agent | Role (default — owner may reassign) |
|----------------------|--------------|-------|------|
| `codex-arch` | `codex-architect` | Codex | **architect** — PLAN/spec, implementation routing, review, independent verify |
| `grok-impl` | `grok-impl` | Grok | **default implementer** — code/test/docs/ship from the architect's locked spec |
| `claude-impl` | `claude-impl` | Claude Code | parallel/fallback implementation lane |
| `codex-impl` | `codex-impl` | Codex | cross-vendor fallback implementation lane; workspace-write |
| `claude-rev` | `claude-review` | Claude Code | **primary** plan_review R{n} |
| `codex-rev` | `codex-review` | Codex | secondary / adversarial |
| `grok-rev` | `grok-review` | Grok | **reserve** — 기본 미배정. 오너가 로테이션 편입 시 이 칸을 수정 |

The architect, `*-impl`, and `*-rev` profiles may run the same agent product, but
they are different Loom peer identities with different mandates. Never mix roles
in one terminal; verify `LOOM_PROFILE` at session start.

### One-shot setup (preferred) — 0.17 Launcher UX

```bash
cd /path/to/Loom   # or fable-advisor local path
bun run dogfood:up            # 0.17: ensure room + join all + sticky host per profile (background)
# bun run dogfood:up -- --fresh     # force new invite first
# bun run dogfood:up -- --status    # report host online/offline per profile (no spawn)

bun run dogfood:status        # invite + peers for all six active profiles
```

`dogfood:up` brings **every profile online in the background** (a sticky host each,
started sequentially per M-28), then binds the seventh infrastructure identity
`mac-node` to the same room and starts its herdr bridge. It refuses to rebind a
bridge with in-flight cards. Close the terminal — peers and bridge stay online.
Stop all sticky hosts with `bun run loom down`; stop the bridge separately with
`bun run loom --profile mac-node bridge stop`.

**herdr version gate:** the owner standard is current **herdr 0.7.5 / protocol
17**. `dogfood:up`/`dogfood:bridge` run `bun run dogfood:herdr` before room or
bridge mutation and require Loom's committed adapter protocol to match. Loom is
still protocol 16 at this checkpoint, so dispatch is intentionally blocked until
the adapter migration lands. Changing only bridge config to 17 creates a
false-positive startup. See
[`spikes/HERDR-0.7.5-COMPAT.md`](./spikes/HERDR-0.7.5-COMPAT.md).

`dogfood:room` still exists for **join-only** setup. Note (L-34): with auto-host
default-on, each `room join` first stops the old-session host, then starts a new one
— so an individual join can take **up to ~8s** while the sticky host becomes ready.
`dogfood:up` suppresses per-join auto-host (`LOOM_NO_AUTO_HOST=1`) and batches the
hosts in one `loom up`, which is faster and clearer.

Saved invite recovery is narrow: if the architect rejoin returns the definitive
`No room for code` response, `dogfood:up` treats `.loom/dogfood-room.env` as stale
and creates a fresh room automatically. Authentication, relay, or other join
failures remain fail-closed and retain the saved invite for diagnosis.

State (gitignored): `.loom/dogfood-room.env`, `.loom/dogfood-next-session.txt`

### Daily (after setup) — architect direct, workers via bridge card

Peers are already **online in the background** from `dogfood:up`; no `host start`
is needed. Run the architect directly in the existing herdr pane. Worker TUIs are
created only by `dispatch_card → mac-node bridge → herdr pane`.

```bash
# A — existing Codex/herdr architect pane
bun run dogfood:architect
# first prompt: scripts/dogfood-architect-boot.txt

# infrastructure preflight/recovery (normally dogfood:up/architect does this)
bun run dogfood:bridge
```

`dogfood:architect` uses `loom run codex --write-user-config -- --version` only as
a short, non-interactive MCP config writer. That process exits, then the script
`exec`s Codex directly. A live Loom relay client therefore never shares the
full-screen TUI's PTY.

**Do not launch an interactive agent with `loom run codex|grok|claude` in a
worker/architect pane.** `loom run` keeps a relay client whose handoff, peer-join,
chat, and error callbacks write asynchronously to the same terminal. Those writes
can interleave with the agent TUI redraw and corrupt the screen.

### Codex architect → Grok implementation path

1. `codex-arch` completes the session ritual, chooses the gate, and locks a
   five-part implementation contract: scope, non-goals, invariants, verification,
   and return/ship contract.
2. It calls MCP `add_task` with `notify:false`, then `dispatch_card` with the
   returned task id, `node:"mac-node"`, `agentKind:"grok"`, and the complete
   contract. Use `scripts/dogfood-worker-card-prompt.txt` as the prompt skeleton.
3. `dispatch_card` moves the card to `doing/mac-node`; the bridge creates a Grok
   herdr pane and injects the literal prompt. The architect does not edit
   overlapping files while the card is in flight.
4. Grok edits/tests but does not ship on the implementation card. The architect
   claims `card.done`, calls `apply_card_result`, then checks both the unique pane
   marker and the shared worktree before independent verification. A `card.done`
   handoff by itself is not proof of success.
5. Corrections are new explicit cards. After verification, dispatch a separate
   `[SHIP]` card to commit/push the already-reviewed diff and return the SHA; Codex
   confirms the remote and updates gate bookkeeping.

```jsonc
// Loom MCP calls from the architect session
add_task({
  "title": "<locked implementation task>",
  "notes": "<scope/non-goals/invariants/verification/return contract>",
  "notify": false
})
dispatch_card({
  "taskId": "<task id returned above>",
  "node": "mac-node",
  "agentKind": "grok",
  "prompt": "<five-part locked spec + unique final marker>"
})
```

Boot/prompt templates: `scripts/dogfood-architect-boot.txt` and
`scripts/dogfood-worker-card-prompt.txt`. `scripts/dogfood-grok-impl-boot.txt`
remains only for explicit peer-TUI fallback diagnosis, not the default lane.

### 1.1 Three implementers — avoid double work

`grok-impl` (Grok), `claude-impl` (Claude), and `codex-impl` (Codex) all write
product code against the **same git working tree**. Without
coordination they can pick up the same PATCH/phase and collide (merge conflicts,
duplicate PLAN sections). Rule:

1. Before dispatching, run `check_handoffs` + `list_tasks` and look for a card
   already `doing` whose scope overlaps. If found, do not dispatch duplicate work.
2. `dispatch_card` is the claim transition: it moves the existing card to `doing`
   and assigns the bridge node. Do not pre-claim it under a peer profile.
3. Prefer explicit `agentKind` routing (`grok`, `claude`, or `codex`) and put the
   lane role in the literal card prompt. The node owns execution; the peer profile
   remains a room identity, not the worker pane identity.
4. If both sessions are mid-flight on unrelated phases, that's fine — the
   collision risk is same-phase/same-PATCH, not general parallelism.

| Codex flag | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `-a never` / `--ask-for-approval never` | Do not prompt the human for command approval; failures return to the model |
| `-s workspace-write` / `--sandbox workspace-write` | Sandbox: write only inside the workspace (not danger-full-access) |

Outside the sandbox, commands **fail** instead of asking — safer than `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`.

**Reviewer boot prompt (paste as first message):**  
`scripts/dogfood-reviewer-boot.txt` — forces `check_handoffs` → claim `[R-REQUEST]`.

### 1.2 Impl lane escalation — the session model does NOT hand-code a locked spec

The architect (session model, e.g. Opus/Fable) authors specs, reviews, and
verifies. It **does not write product code from an approved/locked spec** —
implementation is delegated. When work is ready to implement, pick a lane by
**availability**, escalating down this chain (check first, don't assume from a
stale HANDOFF note):

1. **Default:** `grok-impl` (Grok) — verify auth (`grok` CLI logged in). If expired, don't stop here.
2. **Cross-vendor fallback:** `codex-impl` (Codex / GPT-5.x) — verify `codex` CLI installed + authenticated. Use when grok is down or a second model family is wanted.
3. **Last resort — neither external CLI lane available:** the architect **still does not hand-code**. Spawn a **lower-tier in-harness model** subagent (`Agent` / `Workflow`) to implement from the locked spec, given the full five-part spec. The session model then reviews the diff and verifies. **Effort tracks the task, not the model tier** — and applies only at this in-harness tier (cross-vendor lanes carry their own reasoning config; never set Anthropic `effort` on them). Defaults:
   - **Locked-spec implementation** → `model: sonnet`, `effort: xhigh` (a locked spec is coding/agentic work, for which `xhigh` is the documented default — Claude Code's own default).
   - **Trivial mechanical edit** → `model: haiku` — **pass no `effort` param** (Haiku 4.5 has no effort knob; setting `effort` is a hard API error).

   Do **not** invert this into a "lower tier → higher effort" ladder: Haiku has no bottom rung (it takes no effort), and the mirror image would run verify/judge tiers at low effort — exactly backwards. Verify/judge stays at `high` (the API default when `effort` is omitted) or `max` for adversarial judging.

**The criterion is spec-lockedness, not raw difficulty.** Intelligence is spent at plan time (approved PLAN + R{n} locks), so a locked spec tolerates a mid-tier implementer. **Corollary:** if a task seems to need the **Opus/Fable tier** *to implement* (not merely `xhigh` — `xhigh` is the normal locked-spec effort above), the spec is not actually locked — send it back to the architect as **spec work** (PLAN/R{n}), do not raise the implementer tier to compensate. (Adversarial verify/judge tiers are governed by §2 / Standing rules, not this step.)

Rule of thumb: **check available lanes → delegate to the highest available →
only escalate to a lower-tier model, never to hand-coding by the session
model.** "The default lane is down" is a reason to move down the chain, *not* a
license for the architect to implement directly. (Lesson: 2026-07-11 —
`tasks/lessons.md`.)

### 1.3 Pane 배치 규칙 (owner 지시, 2026-07-19)

herdr 워커/모니터 pane 배치는 **탭당 최대 4개(좌우 수평 나란히)** — 초과분은 **새 탭을 만들어**
띄운다 (`herdr pane move <id> --new-tab`). 슬롯 관례: 아키텍트 pane 좌측 ·
워커 pane을 그 오른쪽부터 좌→우로 채움 · 로그/모니터 pane은 같은 탭 내 추가 우측 슬롯.

운영 주의: **브릿지가 이벤트 구독 중인 워커 pane은 이동하지 않는다** — 아키텍트·로그 등
비추적 pane을 옮겨 격자를 만든다. (pane move 시 pane_id는 유지 실측(2026-07-19)이나,
card.done 구독이 걸린 pane을 옮길 이유가 없다 — 보수 기본값.) 같은 탭 내 `pane move`는
no-op(`reason=same_tab`)이므로 재배치는 임시 탭 경유(`--new-tab` → `--tab <원탭> --split …`).

## 2. Claude Code — **must** consult the `fable-advisor` subagent for reviews

When Claude (profile `claude-rev` or any Claude session) receives a Loom **review request**
(`[R-REQUEST]`, “Fable 리뷰”, “R{n}”, plan pending-review handoff):

### Mandatory sequence

1. **Do not implement.** Read-only except `docs/plan_review.md` (and Open/header sync).
2. Spawn the **`fable-advisor`** subagent (`model: fable`, read-only).
3. Pass the advisor:
   - decision = approve vs pending-revision for **PLAN vX.Y.Z**
   - constraints = WORKFLOW §5, security boundaries, stated non-goals
   - options = any design alternatives in PLAN/UNKNOWNS
4. **Act on the verdict** — write `docs/plan_review.md` **Review R{n}** (WORKFLOW §5.2 format).
5. Handoff result back to the requesting implementer with `[R-RESULT]`.

### Forbidden for Claude-on-review

- Writing product code / “quick fixes” in packages/
- Rubber-stamp `approved` without a `fable-advisor` consult
- Confusing **Loom MCP tools** with plan approval

### Claude session system note (paste into first message or CLAUDE.md)

```text
You are claude-review on the Loom dogfood room. When you get [R-REQUEST] or
"Fable 리뷰" / R{n}:
1) Spawn the fable-advisor subagent (Task/Agent tool) BEFORE writing plan_review.
2) Write docs/plan_review.md Review R{n} from the advisor verdict + your code read.
3) Handoff [R-RESULT] to the requesting implementer. Never implement.
```

Plugin: `fable-advisor` installed (`claude plugin install fable-advisor`).  
Agent file: `agents/fable-advisor.md` (`model: fable`).

---

## 2.1 Claude Code — as implementer (`claude-impl` profile)

A Claude Code session running under profile `claude-impl` (peer display name
`claude-impl`) is an **implementer**, not a reviewer — the opposite role from
§2. Trigger: session was started with `--profile claude-impl`, or the Loom
peer identity for this session is `claude-impl`.

### Allowed / expected

- Draft new PLAN.md versions (bump version, write user journey / pillars /
  acceptance per WORKFLOW §5 shape) — same as Grok's PLAN-author role.
- Write product code in `packages/`, run tests, commit, push.
- Apply PATCH lock rows requested by an `[R-RESULT] pending-revision` from
  `@claude-review` / `@codex-review` (mirror the Grok PATCH-then-author-close
  flow — see `HANDOFF.md` playbook for the current PATCH).
- Send `[R-REQUEST]` to `@claude-review` (and `@codex-review` if
  security-relevant) when a new/patched PLAN needs review.
- Send `[VERIFY]` after implementing (SHA, test result).

### Forbidden for claude-impl

- Approving its own PLAN (`docs/plan_review.md` R{n} verdicts are written only
  by a `claude-rev`-profile session, per §2).
- Skipping the claim step in §1.1 before starting work already claimed by
  `grok-impl` (Grok).
- Treating this session's context as interchangeable with a `claude-rev`
  session — they are different peers with different mandates even though
  both are Claude Code.

### Claude-impl session system note (paste into first message)

```text
You are claude-impl on the Loom dogfood room — an implementer, not a
reviewer. On start:
1) check_handoffs + board list_tasks. Skip any task already "doing" under
   a different implementer assignee (grok-impl/codex-impl).
2) Claim your task: update_task status=doing, assignee=claude-impl.
3) Draft PLAN / apply PATCH locks / write code / test / commit / push.
4) Handoff [R-REQUEST] to @claude-review (+ @codex-review if security-
   relevant) for new or patched PLAN. Send [VERIFY] after implementing.
Never write docs/plan_review.md R{n} verdicts — that's claude-rev's job.
```

---

## 3. Codex lanes

### 3.1 Secondary review (`codex-rev`)

- Focus: security, races, fail-open, auth, data loss.
- May add High/Med findings; does **not** alone close R{n} without Claude primary body
  (unless Owner says otherwise).
- No `fable-advisor` consult (Claude-only capability). Codex uses its own adversarial pass.
- Do not implement product code or claim implementer work from this profile.

### 3.2 Implementer (`codex-impl`)

`codex-impl` follows the same claim-first implementation lane as `grok-impl` and
`claude-impl`, but remains a different peer from `codex-rev`.

- Verify `LOOM_PROFILE=codex-impl`, then check handoffs and the shared board.
- Skip any task already `doing` under another implementer; claim the selected
  task as `doing` / assignee `codex-impl` before editing.
- Implement the locked PLAN/PATCH, write tests, sync docs, commit, and push.
- Send `[R-REQUEST]` to `@claude-review`; add `@codex-review` only when an
  independent adversarial pass is useful. Never write the R{n} verdict for its
  own work.
- Launch with the current MCP profile installed:
  `bun run loom --profile codex-impl run codex --write-user-config -- -a never -s workspace-write`.

**Codex-impl session note:**

```text
You are codex-impl in the Loom dogfood room: implementer, not reviewer.
Verify LOOM_PROFILE, check handoffs + board, and claim one unclaimed task as
doing/codex-impl before editing. Do not duplicate another implementer's work.
Follow PLAN → review gate → implement → bun test → docs → commit/push. Never
author your own docs/plan_review.md R{n} verdict.
```

---

## 4. Implementer handoff templates (`grok-impl`, `claude-impl`, `codex-impl`)

All implementer profiles use the same templates below. Route results back to
the requesting peer (`@grok-impl`, `@claude-impl`, or `@codex-impl`).

### 4.1 Review request → Claude (requires fable-advisor consult)

```text
[R-REQUEST] PLAN vX.Y.Z pending-review
Scope: <one sentence>
Read: docs/PLAN.md, docs/plan_review.md, <paths>
YOU MUST: spawn the fable-advisor subagent first, then write
docs/plan_review.md Review R{n} (WORKFLOW §5.2).
Verdict: approved | pending-revision | on-hold
Do not implement. Reply with [R-RESULT] handoff.
```

CLI:

```bash
bun run loom --profile grok-impl handoff @claude-review "$(cat <<'EOF'
[R-REQUEST] PLAN v0.14.0 pending-review
Scope: durable inbox P2
Read: docs/PLAN.md, packages/relay/**
YOU MUST: fable-advisor subagent first, then plan_review.md R15.
Do not implement.
EOF
)"
```

### 4.2 Same request → Codex (no advisor slash)

```text
[R-REQUEST] PLAN vX.Y.Z — adversarial / security pass
Scope: …
Focus: auth, persistence, fail-open, races
Report High/Med only with file:line. Do not implement.
```

### 4.3 Result → requesting implementer

```text
[R-RESULT] R15 pending-revision
Blocking: M-xx …
Non-blocking: L-xx …
Next: fix M-xx only; re-request R15b
Advisor: fable-advisor consulted (yes/no)
```

### 4.4 Verify

```text
[VERIFY] SHA <short> · bun test · smoke:uc · smoke:desktop green
```

---

## 5. Gate rules (unchanged product process)

| Gate | Who |
|------|-----|
| PLAN/spec + route + independent verify | Codex (`codex-arch`) — never claims locked-spec implementation |
| Implement locked spec | Grok (`grok-impl`) by default; Claude (`claude-impl`) or Codex (`codex-impl`) fallback — claim first, §1.1 |
| R{n} primary + `fable-advisor` consult | Claude Code (`claude-rev`) |
| R{n} security second pass | Codex (`codex-rev`) |
| Owner go/no-go | Human |

MINOR / security / protocol → R{n} **required** (WORKFLOW §5.1).  
P2 durable inbox = MINOR → R{n} required.

---

## 6. Session start (all peers)

```bash
bun run status
bun run loom --profile <me> peers
bun run loom --profile <me> inbox
bun run loom --profile <me> board
```

Then: `codex-arch` → spec/route/verify; `*-impl` → claimed HANDOFF/PLAN task;
`*-rev` → process review requests only.

### 6.1 Codex MCP + sticky host (common failure)

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Codex has no Loom tools | Global `~/.codex/config.toml` still has legacy `mcp_servers.fable` → `/tmp/fake-stdio.ts`, or never wrote `loom` | Remove fable; launch the intended Codex profile with `--write-user-config`, or install a managed `mcp_servers.loom` block with that profile's `LOOM_SESSION` |
| Project `.loom/codex.mcp.toml` exists but Codex ignores it | Codex does **not** auto-load project snippet; needs **user** config (opt-in) | `--write-user-config` (R3 M-3) |
| `loom --profile X inbox` shows wrong peer / empty while work was sent | Inside `loom run`, `LOOM_SESSION` used to beat `--profile` | **0.13.15+**: explicit `--profile` wins. Older: `env -u LOOM_SESSION loom --profile X inbox` |
| peer offline / no sticky | Only one profile host started | Start the host for the intended profile; `dogfood:status` lists all six |

Claude uses `--mcp-config` (always project path) so it does not need `~/.codex` style write.

Handoffs are **pull**: Claude/Codex must `check_handoffs` / `claim_handoff` (or human paste). They do not appear as native IDE tasks.

## 7. Board columns (suggested)

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| todo | Planned |
| doing | One claimed implementer is drafting or implementing |
| blocked | Waiting R{n} / Open Med |
| done | Verified + shipped |
