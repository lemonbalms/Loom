## 2026-07-10 — Autonomy, not approval-gated steps

**Mistake:** After each gate (design done, PATCH done, tests green) the implementer asked the Owner “이어서 할까요?” / “커밋할까요?” and stalled.

**Rule:** Owner wants **stepwise autonomous progress**. Status brief → execute next gate → chain the wave → commit/push at natural end. **Do not** ask permission between routine steps.

**Pause only for:** MAJOR product ambiguity, irreversible shared damage, human-only secrets/accounts, or explicit “멈춰 / 계획만 / 커밋 금지”.

**Where encoded:** `AGENTS.md` Standing rules · Autonomy; `docs/WORKFLOW.md` 「진행해」; `CLAUDE.md` session start; `HANDOFF.md` session entry.
